**What else needs to be said?**

Many obfuscators such as [Zelix Klassmaster](http://zelix.com/klassmaster/) are heavy-duty and powerful. However, they're incredibly exorbitant, costing hundreds of dollars for individual developers and thousands for enterprises.

ClassCloak seeks to make available heavy-duty obfuscation features, such as a powerful scripting language, 100% support for reflection, and much more, for nothing more than a penny.
